\section{Uniform Finite-Time Convergence Rates}
\paragraph{Uniform Rates:} It is evident from \Cref{th:add} (special case of \Cref{th:rate}) that the rate for the MSE is affected by the condition number of the matrix due to the appearance of the $(A_P^{-1\top} A_P^{-1})$ term.  However, it turns out that the situation can be remedied in special cases, i.e., when the squared-error is measured with a different quadratic norm. We defer the discuss on uniform rates to \Cref{sec:rel}.
